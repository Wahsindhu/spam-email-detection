larry ,
i have your fax and the message . unfortunately the corporate policy is very
clear and standard on these matters and we cannot make exceptions . it would
appear impossible for us to proceed with the non - disclosure agreement if it
is not consistent with the version suggested by our legal department . please
let me know your thoughts . thanks .
