Subject: rofr q the
Date: 2001-02-01

contract is still not considered to be " at maximum rates " for rofr purposes .
as you know , our tariff does allow us to mutually agree to include rofr
rights in a contract with a shipper who does not automatically get rofr
rights .
any questions - - let me know .
