thanks for the update . it seems anjam is playing hard ball a little . my
initial reaction is to be inflexible because it is a good offer , but on
second thoughts , could you please give me an idea of what is meant by a

responsibilities , career path implications , etc .
many thanks !
regards ,
grant .
