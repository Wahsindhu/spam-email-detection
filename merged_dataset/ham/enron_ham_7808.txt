Subject: first draft of strategy for doorstep
Date: 2000-10-04

here is the first draft of the strategy memo for doorstep . veronica was nice
enough to agree to check it over to ensure we have all offices that are on
the schedule , as well as ensure othat offices are not listed twice .
i ' ll send you another draft once it is nearer finalization .
best regards
